Home automation enhances convenience and security by automating tasks like door locking, plant watering, and environment control. A smart door lock enables remote locking/unlocking via smartphones or biometric authentication, improving security. Automated plant watering systems monitor soil moisture and control water flow to ensure plants are properly hydrated. Environment control systems automate lighting, temperature, and humidity adjustments, creating a comfortable and energy-efficient living space. These systems integrate seamlessly into smart homes, offering efficiency, safety, and ease of use.
